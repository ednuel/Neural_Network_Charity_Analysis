# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis


# Overview 
Extracted, transformed, and loaded charity_data.csv onto the Jupyter Notebook environment. The data was then trained and tested to create a prediction using neural networks to predict which charities are successful or not. The accuracy was measured to see how succesful the prediction was, while using Pandas, Python, Jupyter Notebook, Scikit-learn, along with tensorflow
# Summary
The target variable for the model was the 'IS_SUCCESSFUL' column. The features were 'APPLICATION_TYPE', 'CLASSIFICATION', 'USE_CASE', 'ORGANIZATION', 'STATUS', 'INCOME_AMT', 'SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS', and 'ASK_AMT'. The variables that were removed were 'EIN' and 'NAME' because these values had too many unique values and were not important to the analysis.
